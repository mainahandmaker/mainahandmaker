## About me

I am an aspiring movement ecologist seeking to better understand how long-distance migratory birds might respond to environmental change, and how conservation efforts can be targeted to turn the tide for these declining species. 

My research uses GPS tracking data to uncover clues about how birds select habitat at migratory stopover sites, and how those choices might influence their entire annual cycle.

I am currently a PhD Student in the [Senner Lab](http://www.sennerlab.com/) in the [Environmental Conservation Department](https://eco.umass.edu/) at University of Massachusetts Amherst.
