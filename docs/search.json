I study the role nocturnal roost sites play in the stopover ecology and migratory performance of Atlantic flyway Whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus). By tracking Whimbrel movements during and after their migratory stopovers on the coast of South Carolina, I am investigating how individuals select foraging and roosting sites and working to better understand how those choices influence their entire annual cycle.\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduation Cap BA in Environmental Studies and Visual Arts, 2011\n\n\nBowdoin College"
